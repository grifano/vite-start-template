# Hi ðŸ‘‹ there!

I'm a big fan of design, web development and all things tech, especially
anything from Apple. I also love hitting the road on my bike ðŸš´. But nothing
beats the times I spend with my family and my kids - they're my world!

I'm really looking forward to sharing stories and learning new things with you
all. Let's connect!
